# 📊 Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This repository contains my capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). The project follows the data analysis process using real-world data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago.

## 🧩 Project Overview

As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, my main objective was to uncover how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently. These insights aim to help the marketing team design strategies to **convert casual riders into annual members**.

The project follows the six phases of the data analysis process:

1. **Ask** – Define the business task and key questions.
2. **Prepare** – Collect and understand the data.
3. **Process** – Clean and format the data.
4. **Analyze** – Identify patterns and trends.
5. **Share** – Visualize and communicate findings.
6. **Act** – Provide recommendations based on insights.

## 🔍 Tools & Skills Used

- **Programming Languages**: R  
- **Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Data wrangling and cleaning
  - Time/date manipulation
  - Descriptive analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Business-oriented storytelling

## 📈 Key Questions Answered

- What are the differences in trip duration between members and casual riders?
- What days of the week are most popular for each rider type?
- What are the peak hours of usage for casual vs. member riders?
- Which type of bike (classic, electric, docked) is most used by each group?
- How can these findings help Cyclistic improve conversion and retention?

## 📊 Insights & Results

- **Members** tend to use bikes during weekdays for shorter, more consistent durations—indicating commuting behavior.
- **Casual riders** prefer weekends and have longer trip durations, likely using bikes for leisure or tourism.
- **Classic bikes** are most used, but **electric bikes** are gaining popularity among casual riders.
- Peak usage times vary by user type, highlighting different patterns in behavior.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Launch **targeted weekend promotions** for casual riders to encourage frequent use.
- Offer **trial membership programs** with incentives during high-usage periods.
- Promote the **convenience and cost-effectiveness** of annual plans in areas with heavy casual usage.
- Expand the availability of electric bikes to attract more casual users.
